### Goal

Create visuals which dynamically change depending on the relative date range selected in a slicer.

### Topics Covered
* Where do we start? The data, of course
* Let’s Built This!
    * Create a slicer called ‘Activity in Past’ to switch between seeing your data in the past day, week, month, or quarter
    * Create DAX equations to dynamically change metrics and text based on dates ranges sliced
    * Create DAX relative equations with unichar symbols ie. calculating percent change between this week and previous week
* Recommendations
* Concluding Remarks
